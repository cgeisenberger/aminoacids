# aminoacids
Why do I like cheese so much?

to do:

1. brush up on neurotransmitter biochemistry
2. relative amounts of NTs measured in (human) brain available? Ideally for different areas such as (pre)frontal cortex etc. 
3. Metabolic / amino acid demands of the brain?
4. which neurotransmitters are depleted due to drugs/alcohol? (metabolic labelling of amino acids?)
